      - "In the autumn of 2020, serendipity brought us together in a quiet corner of the city. What began as shared glances over morning coffee blossomed into endless conversations that stretched into the night."
      - "Through adventures near and far, countless Sunday mornings, and the beautiful ordinary moments in between, we discovered that home isn't a place—it's a person. Now, we embark on life's greatest journey together."
    closing: "And we would be honoured to have you witness our union."
